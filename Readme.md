  (this was built in 3.12)
- An IDE that can read python (PyCharm, visual studio code)

## Installation

2. Open in your IDE of choice or a terminal


## How to Use

### In Pycharm:
1. In the project, bar, click on the formula you want to use
2. Right-click/ctrl+click in the body of the script and click Run
3. Enter the numbers/words for your prompts

### In a terminal
1. using the cd command, open the T366 folder
2. use the cd command again to open the folder you want
2. Use the command: pyhon3 {script name}
Note: This method doesn't work cause of a bug.

### When answering the "What size" questions
The answers must match the variable name in the set_size.py file. 

Example: if you want to use micrometers, type the full variable name 'MICRO' into the prompt. 
In general, the variable will be the prefix in all caps, example: MICRO, KILO, MILLI etc
